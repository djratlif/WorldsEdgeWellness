                                You don't need to be in crisis or have everything figured out to start therapy. Many people seek therapy during times of transition, stress, relationship challenges, or when something just feels "off." If you're curious about understanding yourself better or wanting support, therapy can be a helpful place to start.

                                The first session is a chance for us to get to know each other. We'll talk about what's bringing you in, your goals, and what you're hoping for from therapy. There's no pressure to share everything at once—we'll move at a pace that feels comfortable for you.

                                Yes. I offer both in-person sessions in Hendersonville, North Carolina, and secure telehealth sessions. Together, we can decide which option feels best for you.

                                Session frequency is determined collaboratively based on your needs, goals, and what feels supportive for you. Many clients begin meeting weekly or bi-weekly, and this can shift over time.

                                Therapy looks different for everyone. Some people find short-term therapy helpful, while others choose to work together longer. We'll regularly check in about how therapy is going and adjust as needed.

                                Feeling safe and comfortable in therapy is important. If at any point something doesn't feel right, I encourage open conversation. If needed, I can also help you explore other options or referrals that may be a better fit.

                                Yes. What you share in therapy is confidential, with a few legal exceptions related to safety. I'll review confidentiality and answer any questions you have during our first session.

                                Absolutely. Therapy isn't only for moments of crisis. Many people come to therapy for support, self-exploration, or to navigate life changes. You're allowed to seek support simply because you want to feel better or more connected.

                                Emotions are a natural part of therapy. There's no expectation to hold anything back, and there's no "right" way to show up. My goal is to create a space where you feel supported, whatever comes up.
