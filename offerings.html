                                <h3>Individual Therapy</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Individual therapy offers a supportive, confidential space to explore what's been weighing on you and to better understand patterns that may be keeping you stuck. Our work together is collaborative, grounded, and paced to support both insight and nervous system regulation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I work with adults navigating anxiety, life transitions, grief, relationship challenges, and questions of identity or direction. Sessions may include talk therapy alongside mindfulness or somatic-based practices to help you feel more present, regulated, and connected to yourself.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Rather than focusing solely on symptoms, we'll work with the whole person—your experiences, strengths, values, and goals—while building tools that support meaningful and sustainable change.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Couples Counseling</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Couples counseling focuses on strengthening connection, improving communication, and understanding the relational patterns that shape your relationship. Whether you're navigating conflict, feeling disconnected, or working through a transition, therapy offers a space to slow down and reconnect with one another.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My approach is grounded in attachment-based work, helping partners better understand their needs, responses, and emotional dynamics. Together, we'll work toward creating more safety, clarity, and mutual understanding—so conversations feel more productive and connection feels more accessible.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Couples therapy can support both repair and growth, whether you're facing a specific challenge or simply want to deepen your relationship.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Session length:</strong> 50–80 minutes</p>

                                <p>
                                    Group counseling provides a supportive environment to connect with others while exploring shared experiences. Groups offer the opportunity to feel less alone, build insight through connection, and practice regulation and reflection in community.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I have experience facilitating groups focused on yoga-based practices, grief support, and substance use, with an emphasis on nervous system regulation, mindfulness, and relational safety. Groups are structured yet flexible, creating space for both shared exploration and individual reflection.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Group work can be a powerful complement to individual therapy or a meaningful stand-alone option for growth and support.
                                </p>
